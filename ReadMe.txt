Some Guidelines For Contributors

Contributors are expected to add code to the repository by means of a Pull Request.
Code can be initially pushed here, to a branch other than 'master', or pushed
to another publicly-accessible repository such as GitHub. The pull request can
then be created from either location as appropriate. Branches should typically 
be named for the feature or Jira issue being worked on.

Submitting a Pull Request will trigger a code review that will be open to all
project members. The code review must complete satisfactorily before your pull
request can be accepted and merged into the 'master' branch. Your Pull Request
will also trigger a Continuous Integration Build that must complete successfully.

It makes sense if contributions are kept 'coherent', that is, contain only changes
related to a specific feature or issue. It is better to make multiple small coherent
contributions than one monolithic sprawling contribution. The smaller contributions
will be easier to get through code review and CI build.
